Battle Simulator using Floor Field Models
=========================================
(CSE6730 Modeling and Simulation Project 2)


Building
--------

To compile/build the project run the following commands in the root directory of
the project:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

Running the code
----------------

After compiling, there will be multiple executable generated in the `bin`
folder.

Run `./bin/battle` to see a live battle with soooo much action. (Sorry,
currently our soldiers won't listen to the battle call. Lazy bums!).
